## Description

The backend side of a Manga website, it will be able to host and record mangas with the freedom to update new mangas and deleting undesirable ones. Feel free to also select your favorites and stay up to date on them, i will begin to use it myself so i don't have to keep several tabs open all the time since i often forget the names of some of them.
